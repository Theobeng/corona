						</header>
						<p>A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated. Computer databases typically contain aggregations of data records or files, containing information about sales transactions or interactions with specific customers. </p>
						<p>In a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">relational database</a>, digital information about a specific customer is organized into rows, columns and tables which are indexed to make it easier to find relevant information through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a> queries. In contrast, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database">graph database</a> uses nodes and edges to define relationships between data entries and queries require a specialsemantic searchsyntax.</p>
						<p>Typically, the database manager provides users with the ability to control read/write access, specify report generation and analyze usage. Some databases offer ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability) compliance to guarantee that data is consistent and that transactions are complete.</p>

						<h3>Firebase Realtime Database</h3>
						<p>The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. When you build cross-platform apps with our iOS, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data.</p>
						<h3>How does it work?</h3>
						<p>The Firebase Realtime Database lets you build rich, collaborative applications by allowing secure access to the database directly from client-side code. Data is persisted locally, and even while offline, realtime events continue to fire, giving the end user a responsive experience. When the device regains connection, the Realtime Database synchronizes the local data changes with the remote updates that occurred while the client was offline, merging any conflicts automatically.</p>
						<p>The Realtime Database provides a flexible, expression-based rules language, called Firebase Realtime Database Security Rules, to define how your data should be structured and when data can be read from or written to. When integrated with Firebase Authentication, developers can define who has access to what data, and how they can access it.</p>
						<p>The Realtime Database is a NoSQL database and as such has different optimizations and functionality compared to a relational database. The Realtime Database API is designed to only allow operations that can be executed quickly. This enables you to build a great realtime experience that can serve millions of users without compromising on responsiveness. Because of this, it is important to think about how users need to access your data and then structure it accordingly.</p>
